# Origin/Develop Assignment

This is a single-page website built using React JS, deployed with Vite, and styled with Tailwind CSS. The navigation and social media links are dynamics and can be changed from 'constants'. On small devices, the navbar appears as a dropdown menu. For the icons, I used react-icons. The image slider is made by using Slick.

## Note
I implemented Unsplash API ([branch: unsplash-api](https://github.com/Marcellokah/origin-develop-assignment/tree/unsplash-api)) to fetch images for the image slider, but since I'm on the free version and only have a few tokens to request, I decided not to use it. Therefore the live version uses the main branch, where I imported two images from the Figma design.
